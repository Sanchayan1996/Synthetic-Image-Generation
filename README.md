# Synthetic-Image-Generation
This repository explores and compares the capabilities of generative models for synthetic image creation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Stable Diffusion, and advanced integrations with Grounding DINO and Grounded SAM. It contains implementation details, experiments, and the PDF of the published paper for reference"

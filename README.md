# Synthetic-Image-Generation
This repository explores various state-of-the-art image generation techniques, including GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), VAE (Variational Autoencoders), Stable Diffusion, and Grounding DINO with SAM. The project demonstrates how these methods can be used to generate high-quality synthetic images."
